## Intro

This repository contains a fork of [**Koel**](http://koel.phanan.net) called **Koel on the rocks**.
This will add many experimental features such as:
- The capability to browse your music collection by folders too
- ~~A smarter tag extraction for invalid files~~ [DONE]
- A fixed GUI (for example while importing songs with a progress bar)
- ~~The ability to install Koel under a CMS (using your CMS' authentication)~~ [DONE].
- The ability to logout directly from your CMS
- Per user library with sharing capabilities

## Install and Upgrade Guide

For system requirements, installation guides, and troubleshooting, head over to [Wiki](https://github.com/phanan/koel/wiki).
All the steps here apply to this fork.
As a side note, you need node 6.x or later (don't use LTS version, it does not work).

If you are upgrading, see [Releases](https://github.com/phanan/koel/releases) for guides corresponding to your version.
